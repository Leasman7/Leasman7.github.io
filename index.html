          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI started coding in April, 2021, and it's hard
            to believe that it's already been over a year. I have a bachelor's
            degree in Anthropology from the University of Minnesota, Morris,
            with a minor in Creative Writing. Back then, I never expected to go
            into coding. I thought I hated computers. Turns out that couldn't be
            farther from the truth. <br />
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI grew up around a carpenter dad, and I've built
            several of my tables and quite a few cutting boards. I love those
            things, but I love those things as hobbies. I don't care to do it as
            a career. I know quite a few programmers, one of whom is a very
            close friend of mine. I started the MIT Professional Certificate in
            Coding after some serious discussions with him. And now, hopefully,
            the rest is history. <br />
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI look forward to using my skills as a
            full-stack developer. I have experience in Javascript (especially
            using React), HTML5, CSS, Express, and Node.js. I also have used
            multiple different platforms, including GitHub, AWS, Heroku, and
            Firebase. Building things is my jam, and I can't wait to make an
            impact on the world of technology!
