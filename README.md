# Leasman7.github.io

This is my portfolio.
It includes several projects from my MIT web development course.
There is a navbar that should be accessible from each of the pages.

I'm still working on the full bio page, but that will include an imbedded youtube video and my credentials, as well as links to LinkedIn and my repositories, so that my code is viewable.
